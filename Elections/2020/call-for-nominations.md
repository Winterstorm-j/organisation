Dear colleagues,

On behalf of the Research Software Engineering Association of Australia and New Zealand (RSE-AUNZ), I would like to invite nominations for **four** positions on the RSE-AUNZ Steering Committee.

To be eligible to nominate for, or vote in the 2020 election, you must subscribe to the RSE-AUNZ mailing list by **Monday 2nd November 2020** and remain a subscriber until the completion of the election. Instructions for joining the mailing list can be found on [rse-aunz.org](https://rse-aunz.org/).

To nominate yourself for the election, please submit a GitHub pull request for the [2020 nominations file](https://github.com/rse-aunz/organisation/blob/master/Elections/2020/nominations.md) to the [RSE-AUNZ GitHub repository](https://github.com/rse-aunz/organization) or email the nomination to the [RSE-AUNZ Election email](mailto:election@rse-aunz.org). The deadline for nominations is 23:59 AWST on **Sunday 1st November 2020** ([convert to your timezone](https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?msg=RSE-AUNZ+Election+2020+-+Nomination+Deadline&iso=20201101T235959&p1=196)).

All nominations must provide:
* The candidateâ€™s name
* The candidate's contact details (affiliation, email address).

All nominations may optionally provide:
* A statement describing how the candidate will contribute to ensure that the association is diverse.
* A description of the candidate's relevant experience, including:
   * In 100 words, describe your experience of working as a Research Software Engineer.
   * What skills will you bring to the committee?
   * What would you like to change through your involvement on the committee?
   * What contributions have you already made to the RSE community?

Examples can be found from the [2019 Election Nominations](https://github.com/rse-aunz/organisation/blob/master/Elections/2019/nominations.md).

Following the close of nominations, there will be a one week confirmation period to determine the eligibility of candidates. If there are more eligible candidates than the four positions, I will announce a voting period of two weeks, commencing **Monday 9th November 2020**.

The [2020 election process](https://github.com/rse-aunz/organisation/blob/master/Elections/2020/process.md) is available on the [RSE-AUNZ GitHub repository](https://github.com/rse-aunz/organisation/Elections/2020/).

I am managing this election process in the role of _Returning Officer_ and **TBA** has agreed to work as _Scrutineer_. By working in these roles, we are both ineligible to stand for election. Any concerns or enquiries about this election process can be sent to both of us via the [RSE-AUNZ Election email](mailto:election@rse-aunz.org).
