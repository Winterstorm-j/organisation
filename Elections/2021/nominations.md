### Diversity Statement
I am a woman trying to dip my toes in the waters of software engineering, a sector that still leaves an impression of a pimply white nerdy guy sitting in his mums basement hacking the world.  I enjoy sharing my experiences and encouraging a range of gender, sexual and ethnically diverse people to change the way RSEs are viewed by our colleagues.  The more diverse voices we can get in the room, the better the outcomes will be of our work. We can do more to mitigate the risk of bias and shape our communication style to promote understanding and acceptance across all cultures. I am looking for ways to actively engage with others to achieve better, safer workplaces and outcomes for all.

### Relevant Experience

*In 100 words, describe your experience of working as a Research Software Engineer.*
I have worked in research for my entire career (20 years) from a science perspective.  I began in medical research before spending 14 years as a technician in the forensic DNA laboratory. Technology in genomics was moving quickly so I retrained as a Bioinformatician and now work as a Digital Science Engineer (2 years).  This has involved automating analysis and reporting pipelines, dashboard creation, statistical analysis, and ML pipeline development. I am also an advocate for upskilling others in good data science principles by supervising accelerator and Master degree projects, informal mentorship, data carpentry workshops (I am a badged instructor) and involvement in data science direction and data sovereignty policy development in NZs Crown Research Institutes. My role at ESR leverages experience in service delivery of a product that must be maintained at a high quality due to its real-world consequences and being at the cutting edge of data science policy development.   

*What skills will you bring to the committee?*
I am enthusiastic and energised with all the ideals of someone fresh out of university but tempered by the experience of working in science in New Zealand. 
 

*What would you like to change through your involvement on the committee?*

I am enthusiastic to get recognition of the RSE role in science.  I want us to be recognised by our industries as key people and have our acheivements noticed and understood as being different from your average scientist.  I want to improve communication among organisations to avoid reinventing the wheel and support projects to create long-lasting, well-thought outcomes.

*If you have already contributed to the RSE community, please list those contributions below.*

I have acted as a member of the organising committee for the NZ-RSE conference held in September 2021.

### 1-year term (optional)
*If you would like to serve on a 1-year term (instead of the regular 2-year term), please note that here*

I am happy to be considered for any term
